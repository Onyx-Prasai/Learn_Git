# Git and Github

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track and manage changes in their code.

Imagine working on a project with your friends. Everyone is building different parts, some connected and some not. Without a proper system, it becomes confusing to know which file is updated, what changed, and how to merge everyone’s work safely.

Git solves this problem.

It allows you to:
- Work together without overwriting each other’s code  
- Keep a complete history of every change  
- Create new features without breaking the main project  
- Revert to older versions whenever something goes wrong  

This is why Git and GitHub are essential tools for any developer—they keep your workflow clean, organized, and safe.

After studying the file you will be able to work with version control system to track changes in code using git and github. This is based on my study and there may not be everything included but the onces that are included are important.

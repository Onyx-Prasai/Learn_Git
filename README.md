# Git and github

Git is a very essential and distributed version control system where developers use to track changes in code. Suppose you and your friends are working at a similar project for a long time. So in this case multiple friends have multiple different parts and each part might or might not be connected with each other. So, here arise a problem. What to do next? How to manage the project as we know if they are interlinked then it is hard to complete. Or if we are working on a project where we want to add a feature and we add that feature but later we also want to remove it keeping the old copy. So, in these cases we need a version control system where we can control our workflow and thats where we remember git and github.

After studying the file you will be able to work with version control system to track changes in code using git and github. This is based on my study and there may not be everything included but the onces that are included are important.

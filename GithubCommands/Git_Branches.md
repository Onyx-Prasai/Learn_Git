# Git Branches

Branches in Git allow developers to work on different versions of a project at the same time without affecting the main codebase.

A branch is simply a movable pointer to a commit. The default branch in most repositories is `main`.

## Why Use Branches?

- To isolate features
- To fix bugs without touching the main code
- To experiment safely
- To collaborate with teams easily
- To keep production stable while development continues

  ## Types of Git Branches

- **main** → stable production code  
- **dev** → integration of new features  
- **feature branch** → new features  
- **bugfix branch** → fixes for specific issues  
- **hotfix branch** → urgent production fixes  
- **release branch** → preparation for a release

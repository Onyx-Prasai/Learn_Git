# Introduction to GitPush

Suppose you are working on a project together with your friend in collaboration or yourself now you have made some changes in certain files. You have added the changes and committed it too but when you open the original repo in github, you will not find any changes. So, the soulution is here and the file that was committed is ready to be pushed.
Simply GitPush command helps to upload the file from local repository to a remote repository making the changes accessible and visible across all the remote repositories.

We mostly use these commands to push our local repo to remote repo:
```bash
git push origin main
```

Or you can use the command:
```bash
git push <remote> <branch>
```
Where <remote> refers to the name of your remote repository and 
<branch> is the name of the local branch you want to push ie main or master branch
